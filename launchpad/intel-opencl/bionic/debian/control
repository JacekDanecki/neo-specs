Description: Intel(R) Graphics Compute Runtime for oneAPI Level Zero.
 Level Zero is the primary low-level interface for language and runtime
 libraries. Level Zero offers fine-grain control over accelerators
 capabilities, delivering a simplified and low-latency interface to
 hardware, and efficiently exposing hardware capabilities to applications.
